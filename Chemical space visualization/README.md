Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis was performed on chemical libraries screened against asexual blood stage (ABS) 
and/or gametocytes (Dual-active) to obtain a projection of the chemical space.

Molecular descriptors used:
* Molecular weight
* LogP
* Number ofH Donors
* Number of H acceptors
* Number of rotatable bonds
* TPSA
* Ring count
* Number of heteroatoms
* Aromatic bonds
* Acidic groups
* Basic groups
* Morgan fingerprint (bit length= 100)
