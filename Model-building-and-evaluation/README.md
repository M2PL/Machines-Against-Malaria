Notebooks contain code used for model building, hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation. Models were either trained using the MACCS or Mfp 
fingerprints of compounds. Two different modelling environments: 1) an environment for compounds with predicted stage-specific activity against ABS
parasites alone using the asexual blood stage dataset, and 2) for compounds with dual-activity against both ABS parasites and gametocytes using the
sexual gametocyte dataset.
